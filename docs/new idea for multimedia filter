New Idea for Multimedia Filter
Overview
This document outlines a new design for a multimedia filter in a chat application, where images and videos sent between users are scanned for explicit content. The filter will notify the receiver and provide an option to view or reject the content.

Key Features
1. Content Scanning
Automatic Filtering: All images and videos sent in the chat are automatically scanned for explicit content.
Explicit Content Detection: Uses machine learning models to detect explicit content in multimedia files.
2. Notifications
Receiver Notification: If explicit content is detected, the receiver is notified before viewing the content.
Option to View or Reject: The receiver is given the option (YES or NO) to view the content after being informed of its nature.
3. Privacy and Security
Secure Scanning: Ensure that the scanning process respects user privacy and data security.
Content Encryption: Maintain end-to-end encryption for all multimedia files.
Model Explanation
Content Scanning
Machine Learning Model: Implement a pre-trained model for detecting explicit content in images and videos.
Scanning Process: Multimedia files are scanned on the server side before being delivered to the receiver.
Notifications
Notification Trigger: If explicit content is detected, trigger a notification to the receiver.
User Interface: Display a notification with options (YES or NO) to view or reject the content.
Privacy and Security
Data Privacy: Ensure that the scanning process does not compromise user privacy.
End-to-End Encryption: Maintain encryption throughout the scanning and delivery process.

{
  "_id": "unique_chat_id",
  "participants": [
    "user_id_1",
    "user_id_2"
  ],
  "messages": [
    {
      "message_id": "unique_message_id_1",
      "sender_id": "user_id_1",
      "receiver_id": "user_id_2",
      "content": null,
      "content_type": "image",
      "content_link": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
      "timestamp": "2024-06-01T10:00:00Z",
      "is_read": false,
      "is_explicit": true,
      "explicit_check": {
        "status": "pending",
        "decision": null
      }
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "content_filter": true
  }
}
Example Workflow
User A sends an image to User B.
The image is uploaded to the server and scanned for explicit content using a machine learning model.
If explicit content is detected, a notification is sent to User B with an option (YES or NO) to view the image.
User B decides whether to view or reject the image based on the notification.
If User B selects YES, the image is displayed. If NO, the image is not shown and is deleted.
Benefits
Enhanced Safety: Users are protected from unwanted explicit content.
User Control: Receivers have control over whether they want to view potentially explicit content.
Trust and Security: Builds trust in the platform by ensuring a safer communication environment.
Future Enhancements
Customizable Filters: Allow users to set their own preferences for content filtering.
Detailed Reporting: Provide detailed reports to users about the types of content being filtered.
Real-Time Feedback: Implement real-time feedback mechanisms to improve the accuracy of the content filter.
Conclusion
The Multimedia Filter is designed to offer a safer and more controlled communication experience within your dating app. By implementing this feature, users can enjoy a secure environment where they have the choice to view or reject potentially explicit content, enhancing overall user trust and satisfaction.
